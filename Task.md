- Critical bug fixes

### Medium Priority (P2)
- **Server-side validation** - Quick win using existing validation libraries
- New feature development
- Performance optimizations
- Analytics implementation

### Low Priority (P3)
- **Loqate API security** - Monitor usage, not critical (domain restrictions likely in place)
- **CSRF protection** - Low risk due to no user accounts
- Documentation updates
- Code refactoring
- Nice-to-have features

## Security Risk Assessment (Updated 2025-07-16)

### Current Security Status: **Low Risk** ‚úÖ

**Protected:**
- ‚úÖ Payment processing (Stripe handles sensitive data)
- ‚úÖ API rate limiting prevents abuse (DiagnoSys: 5 requests/hour/email)
- ‚úÖ XSS protection via React's automatic escaping
- ‚úÖ SQL injection impossible (Supabase parameterized queries)
- ‚úÖ Server-side validation implemented for all bookings
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization before database storage
- ‚úÖ Client-side validation with user feedback
- ‚úÖ DiagnoSys input validation (email, text fields)
- ‚úÖ DiagnoSys sanitization (removes HTML, scripts, etc.)

**Remaining Vulnerabilities (Low Impact):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loqate API key exposed ‚Üí Monitored with console logging
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No CSRF tokens ‚Üí Limited impact (no user accounts)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting is memory-based ‚Üí Resets on server restart

**Recommendation:** Current state is secure for production. The remaining vulnerabilities are low-impact and acceptable with monitoring.

## Recent Improvements (2025-07-16)

### DiagnoSys Security Enhancements
**Problem**: Multiple security vulnerabilities identified in the diagnostic tool

**Solution Implemented (Incremental approach to avoid breaking changes):**
1. **Phase 1 - Input Validation** ‚úÖ
   - Added email, text field validation with length limits
   - Created server-safe sanitization function
   - Validates all inputs before processing
   
2. **Phase 2 - Rate Limiting** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented in-memory rate limiting (5 requests/hour/email)
   - Automatic cleanup of expired entries
   - No database changes required
   
3. **Phase 3 - XSS Protection** ‚úÖ
   - Initially added HTML escaping
   - Discovered React already escapes text content
   - Removed manual escaping to fix display issues
   
4. **Phase 4 - SQL Injection Analysis** ‚úÖ
   - Verified Supabase RPC uses proper parameter binding
   - No SQL injection vulnerabilities found

**Outstanding Security Tasks:**
- Phase 5: Add database-backed rate limiting (low priority)
- Phase 6: Add audit logging (optional)

**Result**: DiagnoSys now has proper input validation and rate limiting without breaking functionality

## Recent Improvements (2025-07-15)

### DiagnoSys Error Code Fix
**Problem**: Bosch washing machine E19 was returning incorrect "drainage fault" information (actually dishwasher info)

**Solution**:
1. Fixed cache matching to require exact error code match
2. Enhanced search queries with negative keywords (`-dishwasher -dryer -oven`)
3. Implemented appliance-specific scoring system (wrong appliance: -5 points)
4. Increased search results and added UK location parameter

**Result**: Now correctly identifies E19 as heating/temperature issue for washing machines

### Diagnostic Email Reports Fix
**Problem**: Email sending was failing in Vercel server actions when trying to call API routes

**Solution**:
1. Moved email sending from server action (`diagnose.ts`) to client-side (`diagnostic-form.tsx`)
2. Added `sendDiagnosticEmail` function that calls `/api/send-diagnostic-report` after diagnosis
3. Implemented visual feedback with loading, success, and error states
4. Added retry functionality if email fails

**Result**: Email reports now send reliably in production, with better user feedback

### Booking Security Enhancements
**Problem**: Multiple security vulnerabilities in booking components

**Solution**:
1. Created validation.ts with comprehensive input validation functions
2. Created sanitization.ts for XSS protection
3. Added server-side address-lookup API proxy (removed client-side Loqate key)
4. Implemented rate limiting middleware
5. Added security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
6. Enhanced payment security with idempotency keys
7. Fixed iframe postMessage to use specific origins

**Result**: Booking components have improved security but with compromises:
- Input validation and sanitization libraries ready for use
- Rate limiting protects against API abuse
- Payment endpoints secured
- Loqate API key still exposed client-side (reverted for functionality)
- Server-side validation still needs implementation

## Notes
- All development should follow existing code patterns
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Keep performance in mind for widget usage
- Follow security best practices
- Monitor DiagnoSys search quality for various error codes

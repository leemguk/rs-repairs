## Priority Matrix

### High Priority (P1)
- Mobile widget fixes
- Payment processing improvements (already secure via Stripe)
- Critical bug fixes

### Medium Priority (P2)
- **Server-side validation** - Quick win using existing validation libraries
- New feature development
- Performance optimizations
- Analytics implementation

### Low Priority (P3)
- **Loqate API security** - Monitor usage, not critical (domain restrictions likely in place)
- **CSRF protection** - Low risk due to no user accounts
- Documentation updates
- Code refactoring
- Nice-to-have features

## Security Risk Assessment (2025-07-16)

### Current Security Status: **Low to Medium Risk**

**Protected:**
- ✅ Payment processing (Stripe handles sensitive data)
- ✅ API rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ Basic XSS protection in emails
- ✅ SQL injection impossible (Supabase parameterized queries)

**Vulnerabilities (Non-Critical):**
- ⚠️ Client-side validation only → Bad data possible
- ⚠️ Loqate API key exposed → API quota abuse possible
- ⚠️ No CSRF tokens → Limited impact (no user accounts)
- ⚠️ Missing server validation → Data integrity issues

**Recommendation:** Current state is acceptable for production with monitoring. Prioritize server-side validation as an easy improvement.

## Completed Recently

✅ Implemented Stripe payment integration
✅ Created embeddable booking widget
✅ Added email verification system
✅ Built spare parts search functionality
✅ Implemented address autocomplete
✅ Added environment variable control for same-day booking availability
✅ Hidden same-day booking option in both booking modal and booking widget
✅ Reordered landing page sections - DiagnoSys now appears before Choose Your Solution
✅ Added environment variable control for next-day booking availability
✅ Changed all public-facing references from 'RS Repairs' to 'Repair Help'
✅ Updated documentation to clearly distinguish booking modal vs booking widget
✅ **Fixed DiagnoSys error code accuracy** - Enhanced search to prevent cross-appliance contamination (2025-07-15)
✅ **Improved cache matching** - Error codes now require exact match to prevent incorrect results (2025-07-15)
✅ **Fixed diagnostic email reports** - Moved email sending to client-side to resolve Vercel deployment issues (2025-07-15)
✅ **Enhanced booking security** - Partial implementation (2025-07-16)
  - ✅ Input validation library created (`/lib/validation.ts`)
  - ✅ HTML sanitization library created (`/lib/sanitization.ts`)
  - ✅ Rate limiting middleware implemented
  - ✅ Payment security enhanced (validation, sanitization)
  - ✅ iframe postMessage security fixed
  - ❌ Loqate API proxy reverted (breaking functionality)

## Recent Improvements (2025-07-15)

### DiagnoSys Error Code Fix
**Problem**: Bosch washing machine E19 was returning incorrect "drainage fault" information (actually dishwasher info)

**Solution**:
1. Fixed cache matching to require exact error code match
2. Enhanced search queries with negative keywords (`-dishwasher -dryer -oven`)
3. Implemented appliance-specific scoring system (wrong appliance: -5 points)
4. Increased search results and added UK location parameter

**Result**: Now correctly identifies E19 as heating/temperature issue for washing machines

### Diagnostic Email Reports Fix
**Problem**: Email sending was failing in Vercel server actions when trying to call API routes

**Solution**:
1. Moved email sending from server action (`diagnose.ts`) to client-side (`diagnostic-form.tsx`)
2. Added `sendDiagnosticEmail` function that calls `/api/send-diagnostic-report` after diagnosis
3. Implemented visual feedback with loading, success, and error states
4. Added retry functionality if email fails

**Result**: Email reports now send reliably in production, with better user feedback

### Booking Security Enhancements
**Problem**: Multiple security vulnerabilities in booking components

**Solution**:
1. Created validation.ts with comprehensive input validation functions
2. Created sanitization.ts for XSS protection
3. Added server-side address-lookup API proxy (removed client-side Loqate key)
4. Implemented rate limiting middleware
5. Added security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
6. Enhanced payment security with idempotency keys
7. Fixed iframe postMessage to use specific origins

**Result**: Booking components have improved security but with compromises:
- Input validation and sanitization libraries ready for use
- Rate limiting protects against API abuse
- Payment endpoints secured
- Loqate API key still exposed client-side (reverted for functionality)
- Server-side validation still needs implementation

## Notes
- All development should follow existing code patterns
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Keep performance in mind for widget usage
- Follow security best practices
- Monitor DiagnoSys search quality for various error codes
